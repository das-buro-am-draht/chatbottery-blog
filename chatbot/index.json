Chatting with a chatbot doesn't always provide answers to all user questions. Bots are limited in their understanding and knowledge, and even a simple question can push the conversation to its limits. Phrases like 'I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?' or 'Unfortunately, I can't help you. Please contact our support.' are not well-received by users, as they often mean that all previous efforts to explain the problem to the chatbot were in vain. To avoid leaving users in such situations, Chatbottery now offers a handover to a live chat with your support staff. As soon as a predefined passage in the chatbot is reached or the bot recognizes that the user is not making progress, the user has the option to start a live chat. The most important information from the previous chat history is immediately passed on to the support agent when the live chat starts. For your support agents, we provide a separate chat platform. This allows multiple employees to simultaneously respond to incoming live chat requests. For more information about the Live Chat, feel free to contact us.",

              "summary": "The Corona chatbot, which was awarded the 2021 Administration Prize, is being expanded: In order to be able to respond to the current particularly high volume of inquiries and to relieve the telephone hotline, it is now possible - depending on the course of the conversation - to switch to a live chat mode. During the year 2021, the volume of inquiries increased due to the dynamically changing corona situation. While the chatbot already absorbed a large part of the recurring citizen questions, the employees of the health department were overwhelmed with the individual telephone care of special cases. The aim was to continue to efficiently and correctly process inquiries from citizens about the Corona pandemic and to be able to personally respond to individual cases (relevant for the infection situation), while at the same time sustainably relieving the employees of the health department.",

Matomo is based on open-source code and is completely free. Unlike the competition from America, Matomo can be hosted 'on-premise,' and a range of individual privacy settings are possible, allowing for tracking of user behavior to be tailored to individual customer or user needs.
